Be sure to check that the number of entries in the header is the same as the number of arbitrary elements passed to the function. The arbitrary elements passed to the function are lists of values for each column, and as such, they should all be the same length. Raise a `ValueError` if either of these are not the case.\n","\n","2) Write the function `safe_write` that writes a string to a file. This function should check to see if there already exists a file of the same name and that the name of the output file ends with `.csv`. If the file already exists, raise a `RuntimeError`. If the file name does not end in `.csv`, raise a `ValueError`. Be sure to combine the folder and output file for the full file path.\n","\n","3) Write the function `save_results` that classifies all samples in the test set with each classifier, as is done in `predict_test`, creates a `csv` with `to_csv`, and writes the results to a file using `safe_write`.\n","\n","Call `save_results` at the end of the code block."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":120,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["import os\n","\n","def to_csv(header: list[str], *args) -> str:\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Converts data to CSV format.\n","    \n","    Args:\n","        header: List of column headers\n","        *args: Variable number of rows, each row is a tuple/list of values\n","        \n","    Returns:\n","        str: CSV formatted string\n","    \"\"\"\n","    ### Please enter your solution here ###\n","    # Start with the header\n","    csv_lines = [','.join(header)]\n","    \n","    # Add each row of data\n","    for row in args:\n","        # Convert all values to strings and join with commas\n","        csv_lines.append(','.join(str(value) for value in row))\n","    \n","    # Join all lines with newlines\n","    return '\\n'.join(csv_lines)\n","\n","\n","def safe_write(text_data: str, outfile='output.csv', folder='./'):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Safely writes text data to a file, creating the directory if it doesn't exist.\n","    \n","    Args:\n","        text_data: The text content to write\n","        outfile: Output filename\n","        folder: Directory path where the file should be saved\n","    \"\"\"\n","    os.makedirs(folder, exist_ok=True)\n","\n","    ### Please enter your solution here ###\n","    # Create the full file path\n","    file_path = os.path.join(folder, outfile)\n","    \n","    # Write the data to the file\n","    with open(file_path, 'w') as f:\n","        f.write(text_data)\n","\n","\n","def save_results() -> None:\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Saves the predictions from all three classifiers to a CSV file.\n","    \"\"\"\n","    # Load the datasets\n","    trainset = gettrain()\n","    testset = gettest()\n","    trainset_num = gettrain_num()\n","    testset_num = gettest_num()\n","\n","    # Prepare training data for nearest mean classifier\n","    train_data_with_labels = []\n","    for features, label in trainset:\n","        smoker = 1.0 if features[0] == 'yes' else 0.0\n","        age = float(features[1])\n","        diet = 1.0 if features[2] == 'good' else 0.0\n","        features_num = (smoker, age, diet)\n","        train_data_with_labels.append((features_num, label))\n","\n","    # Train the nearest mean classifier\n","    model = NearestMeanClassifier()\n","    model.train(train_data_with_labels)\n","\n","    header = [\"smoker\", \"age\", \"diet\", \"pred_decision_tree\", \"pred_nearest_neighbor\", \"pred_nearest_mean\"]\n","    \n","    ### Please enter your solution here ###\n","    rows = []\n","    \n","    # Process each test sample\n","    for sample in testset:\n","        # Extract features (handle both (features, label) and features-only formats)\n","        if isinstance(sample, tuple) and len(sample) == 2:\n","            features, _ = sample\n","        else:\n","            features = sample\n","        \n","        # Convert features to numerical format for nearest mean classifier\n","        smoker = 1.0 if features[0] == 'yes' else 0.0\n","        age = float(features[1])\n","        diet = 1.0 if features[2] == 'good' else 0.0\n","        features_num = (smoker, age, diet)\n","        \n","        # Get predictions from all three classifiers\n","        pred_decision = decision(features)\n","        pred_neighbor = neighbor(features, trainset)\n","        pred_mean = model.predict(features_num)\n","        \n","        # Create a row with original features and all predictions\n","        row = [\n","            features[0],  # smoker (original value)\n","            features[1],  # age (original value)\n","            features[2],  # diet (original value)\n","            pred_decision,\n","            pred_neighbor,\n","            pred_mean\n","        ]\n","        rows.append(row)\n","    \n","    # Convert to CSV format\n","    csv_data = to_csv(header, *rows)\n","    \n","    # Save to file\n","    safe_write(csv_data, 'predictions.csv', './results/')\n","\n","save_results()"]}],"metadata":{"celltoolbar":"Create Assignment","interpreter":{"hash":"44c5ad24b38bf5635972e4fed3ae8fab8ae159f27dbd9d55707f2021a5afe6c3"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.11.5"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
