# PyML project (second part): bigger picture

## Why does this course offer a project?

In the first tutorial, some students wondered about the bigger picture of the tutorial project. Hence, we want to elaborate here.

The tutorial project has three parts **that build upon each other**.
You build a project that allows running ML experiments, similar to how it is often done in Master theses, research, and ML engineering in industry.
This project will develop over the entire term, where the first two parts focus on infrastructure and the last part on diffusion model experiments.

This project allows you to practice the skills covered in the lectures and other tutorials/homeworks.
Because the project has more degrees of freedom than standardized homework, it should challenge you to think more deeply about the patterns introduced in this course.
This will help you build a deeper understanding that generalizes better to novel exam questions and to projects outside the course.
For example, one way to learn dataclasses or iterators is to memorize standardized homework.
Another way is to evaluate the trade-offs between different progamming patterns in the context of a a complex task and codebase, and ultimately apply a pattern in a creative (and perhaps even novel) way.
After all, Python is all about improved readability, and there usually several patterns for the same task, where the best pattern depends on the context and "taste".
The latter approach not only helps learning, but is often also more fun, especially after you develop your skills!

For the above didactic idea to work, you should **not** just memorize the solutions that we will upload later, but instead actively think about and work with the problem **before** consulting the solution.
Of course, we'd be happy if you'd actively use the tutorials for this, because this may make learning easier (since you can gather feedback without time pressure). However, even if you only have time for preparation closely before the exams, we still encourage you to follow the above approach.

This project is a new idea and experimental, **but exam-relevant**.
We introduced the project because we noticed that some students in previous exams "overfitted" on the standardized practice material, i.e., were not able to generalize sufficiently or apply Python in flexible ways.
To closely align the project to the exam requirements, we will assume that you are familiar with all parts of the sample solution, unless they are explicitly excluded. However, as noted above, the point is not to memorize the sample solution, since the exam will (partly) contain novel questions which require an **understanding** of the content. You can develop this understanding by working on the tasks yourself.

As always, we appreciate feedback, both positive and negative.
